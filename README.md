# AuxMem
AuxMem is a 'Virtual Memory' library designed for simple embedded systems, with low RAM, but access to a file system. The Library will allow you to work with large data-objects easily, while still staying within the constraints of a limmited RAM workspace.

The primary target of this library will be the Nintendo DS + R4 card. The goal will be to combine this functionality with DS Libris to allow for larger book loading and potentially the displaying of images.
